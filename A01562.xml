            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

I will therfore ſweep mine houſe, dreſſe my meate, draw my wine, ſpreade my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, decke my chamber; and accordingly ſeeke and ſue vnto her: If I haue found fauour in thy ſight, paſſe not away, I pray thee, from thy ſeruant.</p>

The Angels came purpoſely to fire <hi>Sodome,</hi> yet all agree to feaſt with <hi>Abraham</hi> by the way. God is ready at once to fauour the good, and plague the bad: can together heape iudgements vpon the vngodly, and ſhew mercy vnto his Saints. Mercy and iudgement are in his right hand, and in his left. Lord let my Soules be, not the Geates; but the Sheepes Seate, and Lot.</p>
               <p>The mans modeſty offers his Gueſts a pittance; <hi>a little water, a morſell of bread:</hi> but his bounty performes it with abundance;

Humility inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cteth to thinke the worſt of what we are: and ſo modeſty, to ſpeake the leaſt of what wee haue. Diſcretion offers courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies with the leaſt, albeit ſhee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends them with the moſt. But (alas!) vice is vertues ape. Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement, the worlds Faſhion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, is growne into fauour: Her guiſe is alſo to mince out her inuitations to a morſell, when ſhe places her Gueſts to a ſuperfluity of meſſes.

               <p>The rude and churliſh refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſall of a well profered courteſie, argues plainely either igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, or immodeſty. <hi>Abraham</hi> requeſts his vnexpected, and ſcarce yet perceiued great ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers (no leſſe would hee haue done, had he found them, as yet he thought them meaner) to be pleaſed to <hi>waſh, reſt,</hi> and <hi>cate</hi> with him; for each purpoſe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering them Water, a Tree, and Bread: And all this not offered, ere accepted;

                  <hi>So doe as thou beſt ſaid.</hi> How ready is Gods Spirit to imbrace the good motions of our hearts entertainement? He that ſtands at the doore, and knockes ere wee are ready to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, will doubtleſſe, (when wee willingly ſet ope our gates to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue him) not refuſe to enter.

               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe was now but a ſtranger, and yet he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taines ſtrangers. Hee that had not an houſe wherein to lay his owne head, affords his Gueſts a Tree to reſt vnder. God loues a cheerefull giuer, though but ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to what he hath. The Widdowes Mite he eſteemes a Talent: And meaſures what we doe, oft times, by what wee would, as by what wee ought. God had reſpect firſt to <hi>Abel,</hi> then to his offering: and here, firſt to the Perſon, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the Place. Where God holds poſſeſſion of the heart, hee refules not to dwell vnder the meaneſt roofe. Poore Cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was it, ſcarce beſeeming a man! and yet (behold) is thus thought worthy God. O God! whoſe Throne is Heauen, and the Earth thy Foot-ſtoole, what houſe ſhall I build for thee, that
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:19357:30"/>dwelleſt not in Temples made with hands? Dwell thou in me, with mee, let all that I am, and haue, bee the place of thine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode: poſſeſſe thou together with my ſoule, this her earthly Tabernacle, her houſe of clay, vntill her time of flitting be: then let her dwelling be in thee, with thee, to eternity.</p>
               <p>And why vnder a Tree? was that an embleme of a houſe not made with hands? Nay, nay, the myſtery is more then ſo; Man had ſaucily preſumed to eate of Gods Tree, and God now graciouſly vouchſafes to eate vnder mans Tree. He that now in a ſhadow, ſate eating mans meate vnder the ſhadow of a Tree, was after in ſubſtance, lifted vpon the ſubſtance of a Tree, and himſelfe made meate for man. Thou that didſt eate vnder the Tree of weake re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment! Oh feed my ſoule with the fruits of thy Tree,
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:19357:30"/>the tree of Life.</p>
               <p>While he but expected them, his face was vpon them: hauing now inuited them, he turnes his backe. Hee firſt made all haſte towards them; but now (mee thinkes) it is from them, that he haſtes ſo faſt. Becauſe hee is ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure of their acceptation, is hee therefore negligent of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement?

Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, Wife, Seruants, with heart and hand, all haſten to their ſundry and conuenient imployments. It is a well orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Occonomie, where all doe their duty. <hi>Abraham</hi> runnes to the fold, the Seruant haſtes to make ready the Galfe, and <hi>Sarah</hi> is buſied about her meale. Not hee in the houſe, which is not working, or willing to worke. Each one does all he can to giue content. Our preparation and prouiſion, when it is with the beſt, and at the moſt; is yet too ſlender to giue God a welcome. When Grace will harbour her within my breaſt, there is not a member of my Body, not a power of my Soule, which ſhall not bee the willingly deuoted Seruant of her entertainement.</p>
               <p>The firſt diſh is but a prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue to the feaſt, <hi>water to waſh
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:19357:31"/>their feete.</hi> Hereby is he equally teſtifying his own humbleneſſe, as intending their refreſhment. Humility is both the foundation and crowne of Hoſpitality. Where the heart ſtoopes not to waſh the feete, ſcarce ſtretches the hand to feede the ſtomacke. Pride euer was Pittyes aduerſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry: Who can at once commi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerate, and contemne? yet (ſuch are the diſguiſed euils of the dayes) how won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted is it with men, to ſcorne, and relieue together? No Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour now a dayes, but with ſome reproach. Therefore muſt a man bee abaſed before them, becauſe hee was beholden to them. To be beholden (I ſee) is not onely to ſell his liberty, but to loſe his eſteeme.</p>
               <p>Proud <hi>Simon</hi> bad Chriſt to dinner,

<pb n="28" facs="tcp:19357:32"/>had the reward of both. God regards our lowlineſſe, hee needes not our reliefe. My Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our is come from a farre to viſit my Soule; the whole diſtance betwixt Heauen and Earth will not meaſure the length of his iourney. I will in one act ſhew my ſelfe lowly; and intend him glorious: I will waſh his feete with my teares, rather then hee ſhall ſhake off their duſt as a witneſſe againſt mee, as Him; <hi>Thou gaueſt mee no water to waſh my feete:</hi>

               <p>One is waſhing, another kneading, another dreſſing, and each one with haſt; yet not more haſte then good ſpeedé. Well ordered Families, haue well appointed Offices; and they ſupplyed by thoſe both diligent, and ſucceſſefull. <hi>Sarah</hi> makes her Cakes in the Tent, <hi>Abraham</hi> fetches a Calfe from the Fold:
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:19357:32"/>A Calfe, not as it came firſt to hand, or as hee could finde in heart to beſtow;

               <p>By this, the Fatteling is kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, the Dinner prepared, all things are ready; and loe! God is come vnto the Feaſt. Behold here and wonder! The Lord is become as one of vs: Diuine Maieſty is come downe from a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:19357:33"/>Throne, to take vp a feate at an humane Table. God is content to be like Man, that Man may be like God. Ah my good Lord? thou cladſt thy ſelfe in the ſhamefull and miſerable ragges of my Humanity; to cloath mee in the gratious, yea glorious robes of thy Diuinity. Thou didſt eate, drinke, ſleepe, weepe with mee; that I might neuer hunger, nor thirſt more; but reſt, and euerlaſtingly reioyce in thee.</p>
               <p>What? Doth the Lord eate Buls fleſh, or drinke the bloud of Goates? Hath hee neede of the Oxe from the ſtall, or the Sheepe from the fold? Doth hee hunger, that filleth all things with his bleſſings; or if he be an hungry, will hee tell it to man? when all the Beaſts of the fields, and Cattles vpon a thouſand hils, are his to kill and eate! God eates, and eates with <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and can as eaſily diſpenſe
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:19357:33"/>with the corporall nutriment he receiues; as with ſuch ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, he now aſſumes. Their Bodies they now tooke, were brought to nothing, and ſo was their Meate. Spirits neuer eate of neceſſitie, ſometimes of diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. God now eates, not of hunger, and for his owne refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: but of good fellowſhip, and for the others ſatisfaction. Not that nature in himſelfe had thereunto an appetite; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Grace in the other had ſo cheerefully beſtowed it. Yet oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times will God ſtoope to the act of our nature; that we might reach to the works of his Grace. Lord! thou that didſt put on the ſhape of my image, renew mee (I pray thee) according to the likeneſſe of thine owne; that as thou haſt once liued, moued, and beene in me, ſo may I alſo in thee, world without end.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> is ſuch a Seruant to ſtrangers, that he neglects to be
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:19357:34"/>Lord in his owne houſe. He that had others to waite vpon him, will himſelfe waite vpon others. And though he commit the care of his owne prouiſion to his Seruants, hee will ſee that his Strangers be prouided for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. An ordinary Hoſte will ſit ſtill, and command his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uants: the Patriarch himſelfe will giue attendance to his gueſts. Both his cheare, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uice is at their command; ſo willing is hee to vndergoe both the Charge and Office of their entertainement. Whether it were Cuſtome to all, or rather Courteſie to them, hee turnes Seruitor the while, and waites vpon the Table. Hee ſits not with them,
<note place="margin">Gen. 18.8</note> hee ſtands but by them; <hi>He ſtood himſelfe by them vnder the Tree, and they did eate.</hi> The Godly man refuſes no of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, whereby to giue God atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. Hee thinkes him then higheſt promoted, when hee
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:19357:34"/>doth him beſt ſeruice. Oh that I were worthy to ſtand by my Table, while my Lord eates with me; or to kneele at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, when I eate him.</p>
               <p>A free heart, and yet but fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gall cheare. <hi>Cakes,</hi> and a <hi>Calfe, Butter</hi> and <hi>Milke,</hi> are at once the firſt and ſecond courſe. He bids not ſpare their ſtomackes, and breathe awhile from the firſt diſh, to expect more ſumptuous fare in the next: at once they ſee their cheare, and haue their welcome. <hi>Abraham</hi> will feaſt in frugality, let <hi>Diues</hi> glut in ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluity. Saints Feaſtings ought not to bee ſo dainty, as whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome. Let the world alone with this vanity, reiecting ſobriety, to wallow in exceſſe. <hi>Abrahams</hi> cheare was, though frugall, yet hoſpitable. Who would haue thought, to haue found ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainement vnder an Oake? How many are there, build great <hi>Babels</hi> for their honour, and yet
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:19357:35"/>her ſtately pillar yeelds not the like reliefe to ſtrangers, as the leaſt branch of this homely Tree? Both (me thinkes) agree not; ſuch curious Harbours, ſo careleſſe hoſpitality. In my pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage, I would rather chooſe to lodge vnder <hi>Abrahams</hi> Tree, then ſhroud within the hard and bare ſtones of the goodlieſt Pallaces; which beare an aſpect of ſo fayre promiſes, and are fraught with the furniture of ſo ſmall performance.</p>
               <p>The Gueſts are now ſufficed; their Hoſte alſo ſhall be ſatisfied. The Men haue thought, and are agreed, how to requite his courteſie. No man euer enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained God with loſſe. Who euer gaue him a dry morſell, which he requited not with an honey-combe? Who giues him a cup of cold water, which hee rewards not with the water of life?</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> alone hath attended
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:19357:35"/>on the table, but (the Gueſts would ſee, and thanke their Hoſteſſe) he muſt call in <hi>Sarah,</hi> that ſhe together with him, may gather vp the ſhot. And where is <hi>Sarah?</hi> not gadding abroad as a Goſſip, but within doores, like a good Huſwife well buſied in her Tent. While the Woman is calling, or comming, meane while the Men haue thought; What more then wonted kinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe is it, they haue receiued at their hands, themſelues but ſtrangers to them? His whole Family, Ciuilly, how ordered? Religiouſly, how inſtructed? And who ſhall doe thus when <hi>Abraham</hi> is layd in his duſt? Hauing thus pondered, thus al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo haue they promiſed: To hold vp his fathers Houſe, and Hoſpitality; <hi>Sarah thy Wife,</hi>

<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 21.5.</note> after that, ere hee ſet an eye on the promiſed feed. God does not many good things on the ſudden; that ſo hee may exerciſe the patient abiding of the Saints. Now of a long time receiued he nothing of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, but words onely: No thing was yet done, according to what was ſaid: And the longer, the more vnlikely, ſeeing to ſuch an act euery day ſeemed more vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>apt then other. God will haue his many times to belieue him beyond their Reaſon, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him beyond their Times, and to truſt him beyond their Meanes. Gods promiſes are not alwayes ſo ſoone, as ſure, nor ſo palpable to vs, as poſſible to
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:19357:39"/>himſelfe. He ſlowes his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes on purpoſe, not that hee loues to prolong the content, but examine the patience of his Seruants. He the rather deferres yet to doe it, that ſo they may ſee, what they want themſelues; where to haue what they want; how to prize what they haue. Poſſeſſe I my ſoule in patience, long look't for will come at laſt: My Sauiour was long promiſed, before he came; and hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed long to come againe. Oh let me haue Faith in his firſt, and Hope in his ſecond Comming!</p>
               <p>God not onely did with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> and <hi>Abimelech</hi> from <hi>Sarah,</hi> but of a long time, with-held <hi>Sarah</hi> from <hi>Abraham</hi> himſelfe: for ſo ſhee ſaith, <hi>The Lord hath reſtrained me.</hi>

They thinke it ſufficient that God hath coupled them, but thinke not who hath
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:19357:40"/>with-held them. It could not but glad me, to be multiplyed amongſt others, nor ſhall it but content me, to be ſtinted to my ſelfe.

Yet were it ſo, would I not ſo irke it; conſidering in ſuch a caſe, whoſe leaue, and ſtrength it is, that muſt both bid, and helpe vs to worke our owne. It was thought a great reproach of old, to be coupled, and not increaſed: I thinke it not ſo now, but rather a leſſe coſt, and care. There was then a want, to inherit, and vphold: but Men are now ſo many, as that they burthen and conſume a World.</p>

While the <hi>Iſrael</hi> of the Church includes mee, and the <hi>Aegypt</hi> of the world incloſes it, I will count him but a ſlaue vnder me, that is not a fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeruant with me. And if euer it ſo fall out, that hee doth violently ſtoope vpon me, to exact what hee ſhould render, and vſurpe where he ſhould obſerue.

               <p>
                  <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> are cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants: The Bond-woman and Free are conioyned, the rather that they may be diſtinguiſhed: They come together, that they may be put aſunder, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt not one without another. It ſo fareth with the Church of God, as with the Body of man, as with the Houſe of <hi>Abraham:</hi> all haue life, ſtrength, growth, in a proportionall compact of remitted contraries. One ſtands in the compoſure of Hot and Cold, another in the relation of Bond and Free; another in the mixture of Good, and Bad.

It was not for ſatisfaction of luſt, but procreation of children, they all ſo agree together: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>Abraham</hi> takes <hi>Hagar,</hi> not as an Harlot, but as another Wife.

A little liberty makes a ſeruile condition, but the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther impatient of ſubiection. She had now borne a Seruants puniſhment, but that ſhe was brought to a Miſtreſſes conceit. Rather will ſhe breake the reins, then bow vnder the yoke: And (as is wont with Seruants) turne Fugitiue, rather then be made ſubmiſſiue. Yet neither hath ſhe long, nor farre wandred in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinacy, ere that (as ſhe is ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moned) ſhe returnes in humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.

               <p>Now <hi>Hagars</hi> time growes neare, in which neceſſity would enforce her to lay downe her load at his feet, by whoſe helpe ſhe had ſo readily taken it vp. The Bond-woman hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued iniquity, and ſhe brings forth ſhame.

Loe now a Man-child ſo like his Mother; that (ſaue his ſhaping) had nothing of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Free-woman is yet barren, when (behold) a Brat is ingendred vnto bondage. The

               <p>When <hi>Hagar</hi> had but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued, <hi>Sarah</hi> was deſpiſed in her eyes; but though <hi>Sarah</hi> hath Borne, yet is <hi>Hagar</hi> no whit vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler in her eſteeme. The wicked are proud of Gods leaſt gifts, to

               <p>
                  <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar</hi> are vnder one roofe, and both bring forth: So are Grace and Nature in one body, and both beare fruit.

<pb n="68" facs="tcp:19357:54"/>He now diſcouered ſome euill againſt his brother in ſport, which he might doe him in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt afterwards: Or might ſo play with him, as a Cat with a Mouſe; which dallies a little, but deuoures at length: Or might vpbraid him with his Mothers old age, and long barrenneſſe, might ſo deride him, as that he (forſooth) ſhould be the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed feede; might boaſt himſelfe the firſt borne, and therefore his Fathers heyre. While <hi>Iſmael</hi> is thus laughing <hi>Iſaac</hi> to ſcorne, with no leſſe deriſion to the Promiſe, then indignation to his perſon: <hi>Sarah</hi> (as Mothers care is tender, and frequent) is readily ſenſible of her Sonnes abuſe.

               <p>If <hi>Iſmael</hi> begin ſo ſoone to mocke <hi>Iſaac, Sarah</hi> feares hee will euen ſupplant him at length. <hi>Abraham</hi> and ſhe, both are well ſtricken in yeares; if they ſhould dye during his minority, what then would he doe vnto him? Wherefore, to preuent the worſt, rather then he ſhall diuide the inheritance with his Brother, ſhe ſeekes and ſues to diuide the Brethren:
<note place="margin">Gen 21.10</note>

<pb n="70" facs="tcp:19357:55"/>beholds iniquity, to obſcure, but iudge it. What now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of <hi>Iſmaels</hi> ſpite and wrong? The wrath of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, is but as the crackling of thornes vnder the pot, ſuddenly kindled, wretchedly vehement, ſoone extinct. While the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and fruitleſſe Fig-tree, is bold, and boaſting to ouertop the choſen Cedar of <hi>Libanus,</hi> by him but deemed ſo vile a ſhrub: Loe, the axe is already laid to the Tree, to hew it downe root and branch: <hi>Caſt out this Bond. woman and her Sonne.</hi> And doth the Sonne ſinne alone, and muſt the Mother ſmart together with him? Iuſtice ſometimes deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth from the Parents to the fourth generation of Children, but aſcendeth neuer from Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, to ſo much as the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Parents, vnleſſe as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uict delinquents as touching the ſame offence. The Sonne is commonly lyable to his Fathers
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:19357:55"/>debts, the Father neuer to his Sonnes, but by condition. It is likely that <hi>Hagar</hi> (who did not ſticke to deſpiſe her Miſtreſſe) was alſo acceſſary to this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of her Sonne; either in counſelling him to it, or not cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him for it: and ſo not vnworthy to receiue like doome; <hi>Caſt out this Bond-wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man and her Sonne.</hi> Conſent and Counſell, in all actions, adde ſwift wings to commiſſion. In euill, which is more blameable, the Act, or the Incouragement? If I be counſellor to anothers ſinne, my Fee muſt needes lye in anothers puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Ambition neuer riſes, but to fall: Nor did Couetouſneſſe euer gaine without loſſe. Had not <hi>Iſmael</hi> ſo ſcornefully boa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted of his prerogatiue with <hi>Iſaac,</hi> he had (perhaps) ſtill held the repute of a Sonne in his Fathers houſe: but this ſtrife hath occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned to ſearch into his Pede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:19357:56"/>and (on the ſurer ſide) he is found recorded no Sonne, but a Seruant,
<note place="margin">Ioh. 8.35.</note> which <hi>abideth not in the houſe for euer;</hi> and therefore <hi>caſt out the Bond-woman and her Sonne.</hi> Had he reſted himſelfe content with his owne Lot, and not laid falſe clayme to his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers inheritance; this ſtatute had not beene enacted to cut off all poſſibility of his future title. <hi>The Sonne of this Bond-woman ſhall not be heyre with my Sonne, euen with Iſaac.</hi> Thus haue I heard of ſome, who in the ſtrife for new ſuperiority, haue loſt their old repute. How many might haue inioyed what they had in quiet? onely by laying falſe clayme to others right, haue thereby come to loſe their owne. Let others alone with what is theirs, mine owne will I make enough to me. What profit haue I, to loſe, in ventring to winne? What cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit, in ſeeking to riſe, to fall?</p>
               <p>Thus haue <hi>Sarah</hi> and <hi>Hagar,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:19357:56"/>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſmael,</hi> dwelt toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vnder one roofe; yet at length <hi>Hagar</hi> is caſt out from <hi>Sarah,</hi> neither muſt <hi>Iſmael</hi> be heire with <hi>Iſaac:</hi> Euen ſo Grace, and Nature, the Spirit, and the Fleſh, may reſide in one body; Good and Bad, in one Church: But corruption in the end proues a caſt-away, neither can fleſh and bloud inherit the kingdome of God. The Tares ſhall not poſſeſſe the Barne with the Wheate, nor the Goats the Right-hand with the Sheep. Diuine wiſedome indeed ſuffers a mixture of good and bad in his Church, that theſe may be here as farre from Security, as they hereafter from Excuſe: But in the end, ſeparates them one from another; to the intent ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther might know, that till then, they were neither truely happy, nor miſerable out-right. So I be a veſſell of purified Gold, or Siluer, why ſhould I repine that
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:19357:57"/>baſer veſſels, as of Wood and Earth, are layd vp in this ſame great Houſe together with me? ſince we differ here in the whole ſubſtance, and ſhall hereafter in end and vſe: the one ſhall be for honour, for diſhonour the other. Being but one of the leaſt of the choſen Graines, or of the little Flocke: The Tares (I know) may annoy me in the Field, they cannot in the Barne; the Goats may vexe me in the Flocke, they ſhall not in the Fold. Till I my ſelfe be diſſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued, I ſhall neuer be but diuided againſt my ſelfe. Ere my wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings and warrings leaue me, I muſt firſt leaue my ſelfe, and them. I will therefore patiently waite for at once, the ſeparation of Grace and Nature, of the Fleſh and the Spirit, of Good and Bad; and the diſſolution of Body and Soule.</p>

<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 15.5.</note> ſtones, Children vnto <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> and them eſpecially (as * he ſaid) after the number of the glimmering hoſtes of Heauen. For why, God (as he knowes well) workes leaſt by miracles, moſt by meanes. Nor doe the Godly ſo expect the one, where the other is vſed and allowed. And therefore, euen now (that in a faithfull ſeede, Nature may haue her courſe) while vigour cheares vp his dayes, ſtrength knits his ioynts, marrow fils his bones; <hi>Iſaac</hi> muſt haue a Wife. <hi>Adam</hi> was created to generate: <hi>Iſaac</hi> is borne in old age, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get in youth. What though the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:19357:62"/>Father inioyed the Miracle? yet the Sonne muſt vſe the meanes. God workes not for vs onely, but with vs. Wee muſt not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies impoſe all vpon God; in the ordinary euents, and acts of Time and Nature, he will haue vs helpe our ſelues. In the iſſue of theſe things, it is vſually his bleſſing vpon our endeauour. This is an honour, to labour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with our God. I will reckon him but a babe, that muſt haue euery morſell put into his mouth, and leaue him to ſtarue and dye, that lookes for Rauens to feede him. I take it as no ſmall honour, to be the Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment where God is the Efficient: while I thinke, both are co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratiue, my Motion, and his Guidance.</p>
               <p>Next after the Promiſe; it therefore moued <hi>Abraham</hi> to ſeeke out a Match for his Sonne, becauſe hee was now growne both Old and Rich, as appeareth
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:19357:62"/>plaine; <hi>Abraham was old,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 24.1.2.3.4.</note> 
                  <hi>and the Lord had bleſſed him in all things; therefore ſaid Abraham, &amp;c.</hi> Old he was, and therefore would gladly beſtow his Sonne before his Death: He was rich, and ſo had enough to beſtow vpon him. Time and wealth, are two good things to make, and maintaine Marriage. They come together with conuenience, that are hereby fitted, and furniſhed each for other. <hi>Abraham</hi> was extreame old when he tooke a Wife for his Sonne: and ſo was his Sonne then old enough for a Wife. <hi>Forty years old was Iſaac,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 25.20.</note> 
                  <hi>when hee tooke Rebekah to wife.</hi> Maturity is one maine thing that belongs to marriage: and is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired as well on the Parents behalfe, as the parties them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. Neither ought they be too haſty to giue in marriage, nor the other to receiue. This forwardneſſe of Parents is their fondneſſe and fault, they ſearch
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:19357:63"/>now haue their children, ere thus they giue them: They haue but now begotten, and borne them, and now they are ready to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troth them. The Parents vpon occaſions are ready to contract, when the Children haue not onely not the Affection, but ſcarce the Reaſon to conſent. And as their Godfathers tooke vpon them to promiſe for their Faith to God; ſo will their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers for their Troth to each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. To make it according to mens Lawes, they now giue their Hands; their Hearts (which make it after Gods Inſtitution) are yet to giue; and perhaps not giuen at al, or not ſo freely &amp; ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly giuen as they ought. I diſpute not whether ſuch are lawfull, they ſeldome proue ioyfull mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riages. How euer men admit of the Act, the Euent ſhewes oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times how God approues them; Had my Parents beene ſo haſty, as to giue what was theirs, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:19357:63"/>they gaue me leaue to giue mine owne; and ſo bound me rather at their pleaſure, then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed me to mine owne con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent; I now muſt not but haue yeelded, though I could not but haue lamented; and lamented I know not whether more, their Miſdeed, or mine owne Miſhap.</p>
               <p>Forty yeare old was <hi>Iſaac,</hi> ere hee went about a Wife. It were well we could but ſtay till halfe his Age, that liue not to halfe his Life. Oh the monſtrous prepoſterouſneſſe! they will be Parents and Children at once; The Sexes will be coupled, ere you can well diſtinguiſh the Sexe. Children in ſtrength, chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in vnderſtanding, thus goe they together; and ſo there come out Fooles and Wretches. Thus bring they forth, ſcarce well for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med; thus bring they vp, ſcarce informed well. Euery Age of man is not meet for marriage. There is a time in Mans yeares
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:19357:64"/>(as in the yeare) when marriage yet comes not in, and when marriage now goes out. Neither too ſoone, nor too late, is the beſt time for men to marry in. While I am but yong, I will marry not yet, and were I ſo old, I would marry not at all. I would not wed too yong, while yet I know not how to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, and inſtruct a Family, nor yet too old, leſt now I liue not ſo to doe.</p>
               <p>What a world of men did God make vp in <hi>Adams</hi> loynes? He gaue him ſuch an Helpe to vent them, that Time neither through age, nor iniury, could euer extirpate their propagation. What multiplications of all men, for a worlds repleniſhment? What of Good men, for a Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches conſeruation? Euen Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens haue deſired Fruitfulneſſe, to pay this debt to Nature, and their Countries; and ſo haue Chriſtians, to giue God, and his
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:19357:64"/>Church their due. It is natures inſtinct, to generate her like; her ambition, to iiue in her image, and ſet vp her name in her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ofspring: So is it Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces act, and ayme, to renue ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to her owne likeneſſe, and ſo endure in all generations. It was <hi>Abrahams</hi> hope, that his Seede ſhould be <hi>as the Starres of Heauen for number:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gen. 15.5.</note> but it was his ioy,
<note place="margin">Gen. 12.3.</note> that therein ſhould <hi>all the Families of the Earth be bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</hi> Godly Parents deſire, and delight to be fruitfull, not ſo much to increaſe, as to Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe. The good Mother had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther her wombe ſhould be bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren in the world, then to the Church. The wiſe Father think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth he hath begotten, if not to Gods glory, then to his owne ſhame. It were better to haue no being, then to be accurſed. How much rather had I, not to haue beene borne, then to curſe the womb, that bare me not to bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedneſſe.</p>
               <pb n="90" facs="tcp:19357:65"/>
               <p>The vſe is ancient, and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable in matter of marriage, to doe it by a Deputy. So <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> ſent his Seruant to take a Wife vnto his Sonne.
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Abraham</hi> ſent him to take, not to haue her; and ſo was ſhe giuen him to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, not to inioy. <hi>Iſaac</hi> ſees by his Seruants eyes, ſpeakes by his Seruants tongue, takes by his Seruants hand. There is a way to conuey, as to caſt our affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vpon another. The Eare may woe in abſence, though the eye but in preſence onely: And it is that (they ſay) a wiſe man woes by. <hi>Abraham</hi> married his Sonne by the hand of a Seruant: And our God by the mouth of his Miniſters, marryes vs alſo to his Sonne. O my ſweet Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our! be it by thine appointed meanes, that thou marry my ſoule to thee in loue. I will aske of the Watch-men, where I may finde him whom my ſoule loueth? The meſſengers of the
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:19357:65"/>Bride-chamber, they ſhall bring me to my Beloued.</p>
               <p>It is thought (and not vnlike) the Seruant here meant, is the ſame was mentioned
<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 24.2.</note> before. For, who ſhould <hi>rule all he had,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 15.2.</note> but the <hi>Steward of his Houſhold?</hi> and why might not <hi>his eldeſt Seruant</hi> be <hi>this Eliezer of Damaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus?</hi> And if it were no other man, then was he the better ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uant. For why (had he conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red himſelfe) <hi>Iſaac</hi> was the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly man that had put him out of all. <hi>Abraham</hi> was ready to chuſe and take him, or his, for his heyre, while <hi>Iſaac</hi> was yet vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borne; <hi>One borne in mine houſe is mine heyre:</hi> but now they are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed vpon, none muſt be heyre with <hi>Iſaac<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> Againe, there were ſome hopes to be had, if ſo <hi>Iſaac</hi> dyed either iſſuleſſe, or vnmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried. But the pious man, and faithfull, rather executes the will of God toward another, then aymes at his owne gaine

Good men doe rather for Gods glory, then their owne ends: and reſpect not whether they be benefitted, ſo God be honoured. I will ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend mine owne good, as not anothers harme; and not reſpect that my minde is croſt, ſo Gods will be accompliſht: yea, that I might be but the executioner of Gods will againſt my ſelfe!</p>
               <p>What a ſwearing about a Wife?
<note place="margin">Gen. 24.3. &amp; 16.4.</note> 
                  <hi>Sweare not to take a Wife?</hi> and ſweare <hi>to take a wife?</hi> A man muſt be wary in Wiueing; muſt bind himſelfe (euen as by oath) to what, and what not. Hee ought ſo to reſolue, and not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe: ſuch onely ought he chuſe, and refuſe other ſuch. Thoſe muſt he be tyed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline, but thoſe imbrace. Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage without ſtrict aduiſement, is but an ill aduenture. He hath
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:19357:66"/>her for Better or Worſe, that hath a Wife; he that is but about her, ought ſo to reſolue vpon the better, as not to hazard the worſe. Let him tye himſelfe to take a Wife, not profane, but religious; not lewd, but vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; prudent, not ſilly; modeſt, not light, and ſo keepe him to his conditions, and he ſhall not repent him of his choyſe. All things elſe, we try them, before wee buy them; and is there no proofe in the purchaſe of a Wife? Is there an election in euery thing, and in this onely but an aduenture? A man will not hire a Seruant for a yeere, but vpon commendation and good liking; and yet will hazard vpon a Wife at any tearmes, though for the whole tearme of life. <hi>Hee runnes on to experience, rather then examine a Wife,</hi> which indeed is not knowne, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="94" facs="tcp:19357:67"/>diſlike, till now ſhe be inioyed. There's no true content for a man to take a Wife by other then the aforeſaid conditions: Be ſhee rich or poore, witty or ſilly, merry or ſad, beauteous or deformed; in all theſe are their ſeuerall troubles and diſtaſts. A rich Wife will be imperious, and a poore cannot but be bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſome: one he muſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour to obſerue, the other muſt he labour to maintaine. A witty Wife will be oppoſite, and ſo the ſilly one obſtinate: neither will the one be fully anſwered, nor the other truely informed. A ſad Wife will be comfortleſſe, a merry Wife may be ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous; neither ſhall he know how to cheare the one, or how to checke the other. A foule Wife is irkeſome, a faire Wife is ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitious; be ſhe beauteous, others will loue her; be ſhe deformed, how can he loue her himſelfe? He may feare to keepe the one,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:19357:67"/>the other will irke him to inioy. But a good Wife is to be found for all this, of him that bindes, or bends himſelfe to ſeeke out none but good. To auoyd the worſt, is the way to light vpon the beſt. I muſt be content with ſuch a Wife as God hath allotted me, but will ſeeke for ſuch an one, as hee hath allowed withall.</p>

               <p>It is <hi>Abrahams</hi> onely care to prouide a Match for his Sonne, and the care ſeconded with exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, the prouiſion termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſucceſſe. If the choyce of Parents bee herein happily regarded, with what impiety is their conſent hereto refuſed?

It was Parents con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent begat their Children, and it alſo ſhould beſtow them. Whoſe conſent gaue vs a Being, their Counſell may further our being well. Herein to regard our Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents is commendable; nor is the other to be excuſed. Yeares may exempt vs ſomewhat from their awing, but not altogether from their aduiſe. <hi>Iſaac</hi> was now old enough to haue ſought out a Wife for himſelfe, yet not onely askes he his Fathers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but ſtands to his Fathers choyce. Would I licenciouſly runne headlong without aduice or guidance, to put a necke vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that yoke, which I cannot lay off, but with life? or raſhly knit a knot, which Death onely can vndoe? If I raſhly binde my ſelfe to ſhame and beggery

               <p>The Father (doubtleſſe) might haue married his Sonne to a Wife nearer home, then his owne Country, and (very like) of greater value then his owne kindred. But this is it, the ſonne of <hi>Abraham</hi> ſhall inherite his Fathers bleſſing, but the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> (his neighbours) are lyable to their Fathers curſe: Now what com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity betwixt Bleſſing and Curſing, betwixt Good and E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, Sinne and Grace.

<pb n="100" facs="tcp:19357:70"/>Her, whom he findes though with more difficulty, yet grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter vertue. Godly Parents asks not chiefely, how Great? how Rich? but how Good? how Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious? The old way was to marry by the Eares, but now by the eyes or Fingers: there is no hearing of her vertues, either he muſt ſee her Face, or feele her Gold. How many caſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues away vpon Wealth? and are married to Money, more then Vertue: Nay, 'tis the Wealth the man is married to, not the Wife. The man is ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hired to a Miſtreſſe, then married to a Wife: and ſo as if ſhe had no worth in her, it is the Wiues worth comes with her, His, or Hers are valued, and not themſelues: And thus neither Giue they, nor take to Marriage; but hereto rather are they Bought and Sold. Nay there is more Conditioning betwixt parties marrying, then betweene
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:19357:70"/>the one party or other, in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or ſelling. In ſtead of the old manner of Contracting, we haue a new kinde of Couenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting. They are bound ſtrictly vnder hand and ſeale, that ought chiefly to be bound in heart.

It is no honour to haue good Parents, and not to imitate their goodneſſe: ſo, to be borne of bad Parents, and not to partake of their badneſſe, is no diſgrace. Nay, rather are they to be commended, that comming from bad, turn good: and they to be condemned ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for that borne of good, they become bad. In both caſes this is laudable alone; If a bad mans Parents be good, to learne to doe nothing vnworthy his Parents: if a good mans Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents be bad, to labour to doe nothing vnbeſeeming himſelfe. I am taught, neither to truſt to my Parents merits, nor to

<pb n="191" facs="tcp:19357:117"/>haue thought, a Princes Word had beene as good as his Oath: and, that a King had ſaid it, was as if hee had ſworne it. To ſweare, bewrayes but falſhood and infirmity: Truth and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority ſtand not vpon an oath. It is not the Oath that is credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, but the Truth; and were not men falſe, they had no need to ſweare. Hence are all thoſe execrating atteſtations, becauſe men are either iealous, or ſuſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted I will not beleeue the man for his Oath, but his Oath rather for the man. If he be a good man, he will ſpeake the truth, though without an Oath; a bad man will both ſweare and lye. An honeſt man (I take it) is bound as well buy his promiſe, as by his Oath; what neceſſity then of an Oath to a Promiſe?

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He Calling of the Apoſtles was both time<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and mature. Chriſt then choſe them, when he was both to inſtruct and imploy them. Hee ſought them early, and opportunely, ſo to haue and vſe them: as both
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:19357:130"/>fit matter, and Inſtruments of his ſacred Trade and Worke. Therefore he called them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would ſend them firſt were they inſtructed as Diſciples, that ſo they might be furniſhed for Apoſtles. Call me O Lord to thy ſeruice, and that right ſoone; take me to thine owne ſelfe, fit me for thine owne vſe: make me to receiue, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy my Talents, to learne, and teach thy Law; to heare, and doe thy will.</p>
               <p>A Captaine, going to warre, preſſes his Souldiers; a Maſter being to ſet vp Schoole, gathers his Schollers together: ſo Chriſt beginning to preach, cals his Apoſtles. <hi>Ieſus began to Freach, Amend your lines, &amp;c.</hi> (and forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with it followes) <hi>Ieſus ſaw two Brethren,
<note place="margin">Mat. 4.17.18.</note> Simon which is called Peter, &amp;c.</hi> Hauing but repeated the Text, the Auditours next are reconciled. The Preacher is nothing without his Hearers.
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:19357:130"/>God giues his Preachers gifts, for the Hearers ſakes. Preachers are inſtituted of God, but Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers intended. Foraſmuch as the word of God was ordained, not that it ſhould be preached onely, but chiefely that it ſhould be heard. Chriſt is not enuious of our illumination: The great Doctour of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and Biſhop of our ſoules, would not that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing learning ſhould liue, and dye in himſelfe. Could Chriſt himſelfe haue continually beene amongſt vs, he had needed no Diſciples: but becauſe himſelfe could not alwayes teach, hee therefore choſe not to teach a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. The Maſter of the Schoole cannot be alwayes preſent, Vſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers therefore are choſen vnder him: The Biſhop muſt of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity be elſewhere, his Vicars therefore and Curats ſupply his place. Now that he began to Preach, hee choſe his Diſciples to helpe to Preach: choſe to
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:19357:131"/>teach ſome himſelfe, and char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them to teach all Nations. Our Sauiour would not onely communicate, but euen propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the knowledge of his truth. No man is taught of God, for himſelfe alone; nor taught to know onely, but to inſtruct. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is not called or conuerted,
<note place="margin">Luk. 22.</note> but to ſtrengthen his Brethren. We haue this grace and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge one for another: The Prince for his People, the Father for his Children; the Maſter for his Seruants, the Preacher for his Hearers, as Chriſt alſo for his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaid or did little with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, or beſide his Apoſtles; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he would haue them par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers and witneſſes of all hee ſaid or did: And the rather wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, becauſe they were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takers. Well might they teſtifie to others, whereof themſelues had ſuch proofe and experience. So <hi>Iohn, That which we haue ſeene

<note place="margin">Ioh. 15.16</note> but I haue choſen you.</hi> Chriſts intention was to <hi>Peter,</hi> ere <hi>Peters</hi> attention was to Chriſt. Both our Election and Vocation, are ſuddaine to vs ward, and indeliberate; to God onely are they determinate, and foreſeene. Chriſt ſees, ere <hi>Peter</hi>
                  <pb n="225" facs="tcp:19357:134"/>perceiues, nor offers <hi>Peter,</hi> but Chriſt cals. It is no power and merit of the called, but the will and mercy of him that cals. Such is the dignity of an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtleſhip, that it is obtained onely by the grace of God. Chriſt ſaw <hi>Peter,</hi> when <hi>Peter</hi> ſaw not Chriſt. He ſaw him, not onely according to the appearance of the face, but diſpoſition of the heart: He ſaw him, what hee was, and ſhould be, and choſe him for what he ſhould be, not for what he was: He ſaw him, not as one that was, or would be, but that might be an Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle. He perceiued there was apt matter to worke vpon, though the thing was now but in groſſe: he well diſcerned this pretious ſtone, though yet but in the rough. Himſelfe had the art to poliſh it, therefore deſpiſed hee not a poſſible, though incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed good. Lord bow downe thine eyes vpon vs in thy Chriſt;
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:19357:135"/>behold vs, cloathed with his Righteouſneſſe, cleanſed by his Bloud: ſhew vs the light of thy countenance, and let thy grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious aſpect allure vs. See vs now to ſanctifie vs, and bleſſe vs in thy ſight for euer.</p>
               <p>While <hi>Peter</hi> buſily caſts his Net into the Sea, Chriſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly caſts his eye vpon <hi>Peter:</hi> He waites and watches to take Fiſh, and he to take the Fiſher. How the Lord attends his intended Diſciple?

How ſhould the Fiſherman be found, but mending or caſting his Nets? So the Labourer, but holding his Plow; the Scholler, but vſing his Penne, the Souldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, but handling his Speare? <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> is now imploying the One Talent of a ciuill Calling, when the Ten Talents of a ſpirituall

When we are idle, is an occaſion for the Deuill to tempt vs: but when we are imployed, is a time for God to call vs. Let ſinne, and the Deuill, alwaies finde me do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething, that ſo there may be nothing for them to doe: And let Grace, and my Sauiour, finde my ſoule ſo buſied in the beſt things of this preſent, as not thereby indiſpoſed to the leaſt of a better Life.</p>

<pb n="229" facs="tcp:19357:137"/>this is it, both ordaines and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects a Diſciple. The Diſciple is not aboue his Lord, nor goes he before him; it is his all, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low him. Wee haue all of vs Chriſt for an example, in all things that concerne vs. He is gone before vs, wee but come after him; not in the paths of his feet, as did his Diſciples, but (as Chriſtians ought) in the works of his Truth. As a Sonne his Father, a Seruant his Maſter, a Souldier his Leader, a Scholler his Teacher: ſo inſtruct mee (Lord <hi>Ieſu!</hi>) and ſtrengthen me, that (in all loue, and duty) I may follow thee.</p>
               <p>There is a promiſe annexed to the command: <hi>Follow me,
<note place="margin">Mat. 4.19.</note> and I will make you Fiſhers of men.</hi> It is by his Benefits, Chriſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uites vs to our duties. Our lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing Lord, rather ſeekes to winne vs to his Seruice, then conſtraine vs. As Chriſt hath caught <hi>Peter,</hi> ſo will hee teach
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:19357:138"/>him to fiſh for his fellowes: of a Fiſher-man, he ſhall be a Fiſher of men. Chriſt now cals him from the ſame Trade, to the like; from the ordinary art, to the deepe Myſtery of Fiſhing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The temporall was but an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleme, type, prophecie of a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall Piſcation. He ſhall be a Fiſher, as before; onely this, there ſhall not be the ſame Nets and Fiſh. Whereas he caught a ſcaly Nation, being and mouing in a liquid element onely; now ſhall he captiuate a ſmooth People, reſiding in all vnder Heauen. He caught Fiſh by the labour of his hands, but ſhall catch men by the labour of his mouth. Hee brought Fiſh to the earthly, but now ſhall, to the heauenly <hi>Hie ruſalem.</hi> Such Fiſh he tooke be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, dyed; becauſe taken out of their owne element: but now except ſuch as are taken, none ſhall liue; becauſe brought into their beſt ſtate. The Preachers
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:19357:138"/>of the Word are not vnfitly compared to Fiſhers. They weaue the Word of God in me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod and order, and knit holy Sentences, precepts. Counſels together, like Nets; to catch ſoules withall. Their Hookes of the Spirit, and myſtery, are bayted with the fleſh of Chriſt, and humanity. They take men from out their mudde, &amp; Ponds, &amp; Sands, and Sea: Him from his carnall mudde, him from his golden ſands, him from his troubled pond, him from his ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging ſea. All from the deepe ſea and dangerous, from the dead ſea, from the ſwelling ſea and mercileſſe, from the ſtormy and vnſtable Sea. Maſter, thou haſt made vs Fiſhers of men: woe, woe, we haue fiſhed all night, and caught nothing: Our draw-Nets gather more Soyle then fiſh; our veſſels are empty, and much is caſt away. Our Hookes hang continually, and
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:19357:139"/>the fiſh but nibble at our Baites<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The little fiſh finde holes to ſlip through, and the great ones breake our Nets. The fiſhes are mute, the fiſhes haue no eares; the fiſhes hearts are turned with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them; the broad part is back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. Some cleaue to their Rockes, ſome play vpon their Sands, ſome wallow in their mudde. We venture euen our golden Hookes, and yet the vile fiſh eſcape vs. Lord! we can but (at thy command) caſt our Nets into the Sea; it is thou that muſt bring the fiſh into our Nets Our labour is onely in the Caſt, thy power is wholly in the Draught. Wee labour at aduenture, thy power is infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. We fiſh in the night, wee angle vnder water; we know not what fiſh we ſhall take, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can we ſay directly how, or when the Fiſh are taken: Thou onely canſt determine all; that bringeſt them to our Nets.</p>
               <pb n="233" facs="tcp:19357:139"/>
               <p>Chriſt hath commanded <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> Seruice and attendance: nor ſtands <hi>Peter</hi> now to bargaine and diſpute with Chriſt. He is not ſo ſcrupulous, as curious in the matter: that he hath called him, is enough to perſwade him: Neither askes he to what worke, nor for what end? The grace of the Holy Ghoſt neither will be examined, nor controlled: nor does true Faith and Petty expoſtulate, but obey. <hi>Peter</hi> (as now) had ſeene Chriſt doe no miracle; had heard Chriſt ſpeake of no reward; he followes one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vpon his bare word. Alas then, that all his promiſes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not allure vs after him. Call me (Lord Ieſu!) and commend me to thee, without all contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I will obſerue, rather then inquire my Sauiour; nor ſhall it be my Lightneſſe, but my faith: I will follow my Sauiour for himſelfe, nor ſhall it be my duty onely, but reward.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:19357:140"/>
               <p>Where grace is together both motiue and guide, neither is the reaſon there expoſtulated, nor the act ſuſpended. The good Diſciple neither expects his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers buriall, Wiues kiſſe, or Friends farewell: neither ſtayes he to conſult at their mouthes, nor once aske their conſent. (We haue good leaue of our ſelues, to ſerue God.) So ſoone as he heard ſay, <hi>Follow me,</hi> He and his Brother;
<note place="margin">Mat. 4.20.</note> 
                  <hi>They ſtraight way left their Nets, and followed him.</hi> We ought to deliberate, and conſider vpon ſome morall acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons: the diuine Election, and vocation, askes no deliberation of ours, abides no delay. There is no deferring our conuerſion to Chriſt. Chriſt now cals, hee that will heare his voyce, euen to day (while it is called to day) let him take heed, that he horden not his heart. Chriſt will not call him, that will not come when he cals. Delayes but diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able

To day, we are vnready, to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row vnwilling; to day indiſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, to morrow irreſolued; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſing to day, denying to mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; to day but neglecting, to morrow quite contemning: Thus are we euery day leſſe fit then other, to be followers of Chriſt. He ſhall be my canoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed Saint, who readily bowes at his Sauiours becke, that comes when his Sauiour cals: I will chaulke vp that ſoule for a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Virgin, which will delay to follow, till the doore be ſhut.

For, had it beene more, they would neuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſſe haue left it all. They left all, that reſerued nothing, they left all, that deſired nothing.

He could not be all they ſaid, nor was he any: neither <hi>Iohn Baptiſt,</hi> nor <hi>Elias,</hi> nor <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mias,</hi> nor one of the Prophets.

                  <pb n="242" facs="tcp:19357:144"/>They ſaid ſo indeed, but it was but now and then, as they were occaſioned: not conſtantly, and confidently, as they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded. All, and the beſt they ſaid of him, was but from ſome ſudden opinion, but no ſound Faith. All they ſaid of Chriſt, it was but a various vulgars errour at the beſt. The good they ſpake, it was not much to be commended; yet might their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour the rather be excuſed. For, though they did not (as the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples) confeſſe him; yet did they not (as the Phariſees) blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme him: They ſaid not but honeſtly of him, though they ſaid amiſſe. This is not all, to ſpeake good of Chriſt, but well; nor to ſpeake highly of him, but accordingly neither is it e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to vtter no euill againſt him, but confeſſe his truth.

But arrogantly ſomewhat, and vncharitably, he would accuſe all others, to quit himſelfe; and in a grant of their weakeneſſe, boaſts his owne ſtrength:
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.33</note> 
                  <hi>Though all men ſhall be offended becauſe of thee, yet will I neuer be offended.</hi> Did the man but remember himſelfe, hee began ere now to be offended hereat. <hi>Maſter,
<note place="margin">Mat 16.22.</note> pitty thy ſelfe, this ſhall not be vnto thee:</hi> Neuertheleſſe dares hee now preſume vpon himſelfe; <hi>I will not be offended.</hi> When a man is vnmindfull of his weakeneſſe,
<pb n="268" facs="tcp:19357:157"/>that is it makes him preſume vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his ſtrength. But for all that, <hi>Peter</hi> need not haue ſo diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his Fellowes; though hee needs would ſo vaunt himſelfe. It is a weakeneſſe of ours, to boaſt our ſtrength before others; eſpecially, to boaſt it to others weakeneſſe. Touching holy per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formances, I dare promiſe my ſelfe neither able nor ſecure; much leſſe preferre my ſelfe. I ſay none more apt to ſwarue, then I: for I know mine owne weakeneſſe; but am ignorant of anothers ſtrength. Here am I warned, how I boaſt mine owne will and ſtrength; I will (as I am warranted) glory onely in mine infirmities.</p>
               <p>It is neither good, nor ſafe, for a man (in matters that per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to God) to preſume vpon himſelfe. When he is ſecureſt of himſelfe, he is moſt in hazard: while he thinkes he ſtands the faſteſt, is he moſt apt to fall; yea,
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:19357:157"/>while he now ſayes, he ſtands, and ſhall neuer be moued; he is now troubled, and fals away. Becauſe a man preſumes hee ſtands, therefore God ſuffers him to fall. Becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> ſpake of his ſtrength before all others; Chriſt (of all others) tels him of his weakeneſſe: and permits him to fall the worſt; that of his own ſtanding preſumed moſt. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>Peter</hi> was ſo ready to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer for himſelfe, when Chriſt ſpake in generall; Chriſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore tels <hi>Peter</hi> in particular:
<note place="margin">Mat. 26.34.</note> 
                  <hi>This night, before the Cocke crow, thou ſhalt deny me thrice.</hi> Who dares preſume to doe, or ſtand; ſince <hi>Peter</hi> failes and fals? Lord! to preſume vpon our ſelues, is the way to make thee leaue vs to our ſelues: and to ſay we will ſtand, is to bid thee let vs alone to fal: And this is to begin to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thee; not to deny our ſelues. Notwithſtanding ſome endeauor thou haſt committed to vs; thou
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:19357:158"/>wilt haue the whole worke of wel-doing imputed to thy ſelfe. Thou bidſt vs labour a little in it, that we ſhould not be idle; but without thee, our labour is in vaine; why ſhould we then be proud? Our Will is nothing to thy Worke: and all our readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, is (without thee) no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then backwardneſſe. Wee ſtand by faith, not of our ſelues; we riſe, not of our ſelues, but by grace. While I ſtand, it is thou Lord, that vpholdeſt me; when I am fallen, it is thou Lord, that muſt helpe me vp. It is by thee (O thou my Sauiour!) that I doe confeſſe thee: and againe, by thee, if I doe not deny thee.</p>
               <p>But euen now, Chriſt told his Diſciples indefinitely, that one of them ſhould betray him; and <hi>Peter</hi> alſo amongſt the reſt, growes fearefull of himſelfe;
<note place="margin">Mat. 16.22</note> 
                  <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter is it I?</hi> Now that he tels him expreſly, euen He ſhall deny

                  <hi>Though I ſhould dye with thee, yet will I not deny thee.</hi> Wee are oft times more ſcrupulous and doubting, when moſt inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and vnlikely, and then moſt apt and obnoxious, when moſt arrogant and ſecure. Chriſt had cleared <hi>Peter</hi> from being the Traytour, and <hi>Peter</hi> will iuſtifie himſelfe from being the Denyer. He ſpake this (no doubt) out of a deuotion; but he ſhould haue conſidered his owne condition To lay down his life for Chriſt, is not of humane will and weakeneſſe; but of diuine power and diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Neither conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he now his owne frailty, how ſubiect he is to ſuch a thing; nor Chriſts truth, that hee ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing ſaid it, it cannot but come to paſſe. Euen now he denyes the truth, in that he will not be perſwaded, he ſhall deny him. No falſhood more manifeſt, then to gaineſay the truth. But
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:19357:159"/>ſince he will not beleeue his words, the euent ſhall proue it.

He that ſo contradicts his Sauiour, ſhall anone gaine-ſay himſelfe. Rather ſhall <hi>Peter</hi> proue a Denyer, then Chriſt be found a Lyar. Both the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet,
<note place="margin">Zach. 13.7 Mat. 26.31.34.</note> and Chriſt foretold of <hi>Peters</hi> offence and denyall. The Prediction was a caueat, rather then a cauſe of his offence: ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing rather to admoniſh him of it, then inforce him to it. Was the ſinne therefore foretold, to impoſe a neceſſity vp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

God forbid. <hi>Peter</hi> did not therefore fall, becauſe Chriſt foreſpake: but Chriſt therefore forewarned, becauſe <hi>Peter</hi> would fall. Euill cannot take e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uent without Gods knowledge, though againſt Gods Will. His preſcience neither layes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint
<pb n="273" facs="tcp:19357:159"/>vpon our worke; nor takes away liberty from our will. When wee wilfully doe the worſt, he knowes it, permits it, yea concurres with it; to direct the action, to correct the praui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: in all which, he is no leſſe good, then we are euill. Let diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute and reprobate ſpirits ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe God, as enuyous; becauſe foreknowing their iniquities, he could, but would not preuent them: or as impotent; becauſe he would, but could not: or as both; becauſe he neither would, nor could: I will wonder at his Wiſedome, in his Mercy, in his Iuſtice; and not dare to cenſure, where I cannot vnderſtand.</p>
               <p>Now is it, as he foretold; The ſheepheard is no ſooner ſmitten; then loe, the ſheepe are ſcatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. Yea the fore-man of the flocke is left behinde. Euen <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter followed a farre off.</hi>

<pb n="274" facs="tcp:19357:160"/>him that hee followed a farre off: Through Piety, he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowes, and through Frailty, but a farre off. That he followes, is Graces good motion; that hee followes a farre off, is Natures preuarication: The Diſciples de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uotion is to follow his Lord; onely it is the mans infirmity makes him follow but a farre off. He neuer comes neare Chriſt, that followes betwixt Deſire and Feare, Faith and Vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beliefe, Hope and Deſpaire. <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> followes, with deſire to ſee what would happen to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter; but a farre off, for feare what might befall himſelfe. We would ſo farre profeſſe Chriſt, and Religion; as thereby not to preiudice our ſelues. We loue Chriſt a little, and ſo we follow him in word, and ſhew; but we loue our ſelues better, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in deed and truth, wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low but a farre off. That he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, was more then the other
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:19357:160"/>Diſciples, for they fled; but to follow him a farre off, was lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle better, then (as they did) to forſake him. It is to be feared, that man will quite forſake Chriſt in the end; that contents himſelfe onely to follow him a farre off. <hi>Peter followed a farre off.</hi> Had he kept cloſe to his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiours perſon, great like he had not denyed his profeſſion. The nighneſſe of our God, expels temptations. The very diſtance now diſpoſes to a Denyall. To ſwarue from Grace, is that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines a man to ſinne. Euen <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> followes Chriſt but a farre off. What Saint comes neere his Sauiour? Lord, he that goes faſteſt, and furtheſt, followes thee but a farre off. Wee are weake Lord, and cannot goe with thee; we are lame, and lazy, and ſhall neuer ouertake thee. We are Snailes in the wayes of thy Commandements. So ſlow we follow thee, and ſlenderly; as
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:19357:161"/>as if we either did feare, or did not care to ſet one foot before another. Euery difficulty is as a Lyon in the way, to deterre vs from our duty: and but the thought of an inconuenience, ſerues to ſlacken our pace. Wee are ſluggiſh in the performance of Religion; O Lord make haſte to helpe vs: we are ſlow toward the attainement of ſaluation; O God make ſpeed to ſaue vs. Lord, be not thou farre from vs; that cannot follow thee, but a farre off.</p>
               <p>Trauelling betwixt Deſire and Feare; <hi>Peters</hi> ſlow pace at length brings him to the very place where his Maſter was. It was not his haſte, that ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tooke him; but Chriſts ſtay, to expect him there. Not all our ſpeed can approach our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, vnleſſe hee tarry to expect vs. Neither is it enough, that hee ſtands to looke for vs, except he returne to ſetch vs. Stayes my

                  <hi>Peter</hi> was (as the weather was) ſomewhat cold in body; for his ſlow pace could not get him heate with walking: But <hi>Peter</hi> was ſtarke frozen in mind; for his following a farre off, had let the ſunne of righteouſneſſe (both for warmth and light) to ſet vpon him.

Marke him, and he firſt diſſembles the matter; then denyes the party; after forſweares the truth: now he denyes openly, then with an oath; laſtly, with curſing and ſwearing. So raſhly and headily he ruſhes out of one ſinne into another of the ſame; and fals from another ſin, into a worſe. The ſame ſinne, &amp;c The ſame ſinne, recommitted, and vnre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented; hath beſides aggrauati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in it ſelfe, augmentation, by diſpoſing to another ſinne. There be that would excuſe this fact, and fault of <hi>Peter;</hi> and make them no denyals, but doubtfull anſwers at the moſt. Alas, alas, the corruption of Doctrine, as well as manners! How wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they peruert good Authours, to make them Authours of their excuſe.

Nothing but weepes: For hee would onely bewaile, not excuſe his ſinne; would purge him of his filthineſſe by teares, rather then in words, plead for his offence. Words cannot alwayes expreſſe the force of teares; teares haue of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the force of words. Teares are ſilent prayers: they make confeſſion, ſhew contrition, got abſolution. Sinne is a fire, is a flame; which not the ſhowring clouds, but the diſtilling eyes can quench: Sinne is a ſtaine, a blot; which not all the water in the ſea, but our teares, can waſh away. Teares are the one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Lauer, and Purgatory of a ſinfull ſoule. Good God! Teares had neuer beene, but for ſinne; and ſinne had euer beene, but for Teares: Sinne occaſions teares; teares diſſolue ſinne: But for ſinne, wee had not beene borne in teares; but for teares, wee had dyed in ſinne.

Sinnes haynous in the commiſſion, are heauy in the repentance. A little water, waſhes not a foule ſpot. For the ſeruant, to forſweare his Maſter; for the Apoſtle, to deny the truth; was no ſmall offence. Wherefore his eyes (like two diſtilling Fountaines) guſh out euen riuers of waters; and all is little enough, to waſh him throughly from his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, to cleanſe him from his ſinne. Since there is ſuch helpe; then what need is there, yea what lacke of teares? Ah! this is cauſe enough of wee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, that wee cannot weepe. Woe to vs, that we ſinne daily
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:19357:175"/>with hard hearts, and dry eyes; and prouoke our GOD to plague vs; not ſo much for ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as not ſorrowing for ſinne.

<pb n="316" facs="tcp:19357:181"/>paſt recouery. Whether of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uils, or Men; Malice, and Sinne, are equally aged, and ſemblably euill. Both haue the ſame Name and Guiſe, as if there were no ſinne, but malice; Malice is as much as ſinne in generall: and as if malice were a ſinne by it ſelfe, there is a malice, which is a particular ſinne. Briefely, they borrow and repay each other in a mutuall loane; Malice is not but ſinfull, nor ſinne but mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious. All euill is enuious. The Good which a bad man will not imitate, hee cannot but enuy. Alwayes, either doe our owne vices irke vs; or elſe the vertues of another: And, who grieues not, becauſe himſelfe is euill; he commonly repines, becauſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other is good. I wonder not at ſuch enuy inraged, when I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the enmity foretold. <hi>I will put enmity betwixt thee,
<note place="margin">Gen. 3.15.</note> and the Woman; and betwixt thy ſeed and her ſeed.</hi> God himſelfe hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoked
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:19357:181"/>and proclaimed open ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtility, and euerlaſting enmity, betwixt Satan and the Saints. The quarrell pertained not to our Fore-father alone, but his ſucceſſions: It was no more theirs, betwixt whom it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan, then ours, to whom it is ſtill deriued. God indeed loues, and likes loue and vnity in his creatures: but preferres a iuſt warre, before an vniuſt peace betwixt them: Betwixt whom, peace and familiarity hath beene dangerous and euill; there warre and hoſtility, is both good and profitable. Better a pious war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, then a vitious couenant. My God was my friend in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king me and the Deuill foes; I were his foe then, ſhould I ſeeke or grant, to be reconciled againſt my God. If God bee with mee, who can be againſt me? I but ſcatter, if I gather not with him. So God loue me, let the Deuill enuy me. Oh let me haue peace
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:19357:182"/>and amity with God, in Chriſt; warre and enmity with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill and ſinne!</p>
               <p>It was ſinne that ſeparated be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt God and man, that put enmity betwixt the Deuill and man: but it can combine, and make friends, betwixt man and man. How ſoone are we ſworne Brethren in iniquity? The moſt froward and thwarting ſpirits, will eaſily agree to be euill. If it be to drinke iniquity, like water; Lord, how wee draw all at the ſame Well! if it be to draw ſinne with cartropes, and iniquity with cords of vanity; how wee toyle together, and ſweate, and blow vnder one yoke! There is no peace to the wicked, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in themſelues; yet haue they a kinde of couenant one with an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. How the Serpents claſpe and climbe together; Euen Iayes and Crowes take pleaſure to bee birds of a feather: euen the Wolues will flocke, and Apes
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:19357:182"/>hugge. The wicked haue their mutuall and malitious imbrace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: And (which is the worſt confederacy) their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement is not ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelues; as againſt the godly. The wicked conſpire not ſo much in being, as in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing euill: Euill men arride not onely in this, that they are ſo themſelues; as that they would doe ſo to others. Beware the flocke; when the Foxes conſult, or Wolues come together. It is alwayes againſt the true-man, that the theeues ſhake hands. <hi>Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> conſulted with the Prieſts a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Chriſt: So conſents <hi>Saul</hi> to the people, againſt a Chriſtian.

<pb n="320" facs="tcp:19357:183"/>It is bold indeed to inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuate with vs; but ſo, as it askes our admiſſion. Sinne intrudes not, but with our leaue; nor are we guilty of any temptation, but ſo as we yeeld vnto it. No man is euill againſt his will; nor doe we (at any time) ſinne againſt our owne conſent. Our owne euill, is not ours, if we conſent not to it: and to conſent vnto i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To behold euill, and not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid it; is to conſent vnto it. For he confeſſes,

Not a ſtone caſt at thee (deare Saint) fals to the ground: The courſeſt flint in thy Croſſe, is a pretious gemme in thy Crowne.

<pb n="325" facs="tcp:19357:185"/>There is no charity to that of Chriſtians; who are taught to loue their enemies; to bleſſe them that curſe them; to doe good to them that hate them; to pray for them that perſecute them: And of all Chriſtians, no charity to that of Martyrs; which haue ſo willingly and chearefully, both done, and ſuffered, as they haue beene taught. Thou breatheſt milde words for them; while they breake hard ſtones againſt thee. Why prayeſt thou ſo for Perſecutors? but as irkeing their impieties more then thine owne ſufferings? grieuing rather for their ſinnes, wounding their owne ſoules, then their ſtones, thy body. Reſt now (patient ſoule) in the Lord, from all thy labours; Thy momentany bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſſe, is eternally ſeaſoned and ſweetened vnto thee.

Much what like a Mad-man, ſo tranſported with fury, that hee talkes not beſide Blaſphemy, and Tyranny; that hee blowes not, but all threats and death. Threatning and ſlaughter at once (like Lightning and Thunder) proceed out of his mouth. His very Breath ſauours of threatning and ſlaughter: Theſe are as familiar to ſinne, as that is frequent to Nature. Threatnings and Slaughters, he both fetches them as deepe, and vtters them as oft, as hee doth his breath. You would thinke, that rather then in the defect of them, hee would ceaſe to be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill, in the depriuation of this other, would he ceaſe to be.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> is now no better, then as he firſt began. Hee had before conſented to the Death of <hi>Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen,</hi> made hauocke of the Church, haled Men and Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and impriſoned them, and

Who yet knew the ſinner, that liued, which would not liue, to ſinne Yet, or Yet liue to ſinne? Oh the odious, and horrible inſaciacy of ſinne, and hell! How iuſtly are they euerlaſtingly damned; that would alwayes be wicked? Oft haue I reſolued to ſinne no more; God grant me neuer to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerue this Yet within my ſelfe.

<note place="margin">Act. 9.1.2.</note> Saul went vnto the High Prieſt, and deſired of him Letters to Damaſcus, &amp;c.</hi> Who is worſe then he; that thinkes not himſelfe enough, to doe euill?

The High Prieſt need not hire, or perſwade <hi>Saul,</hi> to ſuch a purpoſe; hee both offers, &amp; intreats hereto. Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riry needs neither inquire, nor intreat, to doe naughtily. Bad Officers, are neuer without bad Executioners: may they be but licenced, they looke not to bee
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:19357:192"/>commanded. So eaſily are wee imployed in euill: and alwayes become the willing inſtruments of bad workes. The Letters are not ſooner requeſted, then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained. They ſoone condeſcend to, what themſelues ſo deſired: and cannot now (at leaſt) but applaud him for his forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe; that otherwiſe, would (by all meanes) haue both allured, and hired him hereto. The High Prieſt ſtickes not to grant; <hi>Saul</hi> is not vnwilling to carry; the Letters bluſh not to relate; and the <hi>Iewiſh Synagogues</hi> (had theſe come to their hands) had not fayled, to haue effected. But the Libels are happily intercep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the way: neither were they deliuered; nor vnderſtood what they were. Better the Church ſhould be ignorant, then ſhould haue beene ſenſible of their contents. This one thing I wonder at, that hee that was the Carryer of ſuch Letters,
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:19357:193"/>ſhould be the Authour of ſuch Epiſtles. Who would hope, or thinke, that he that now carried ſuch Letters, touching the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Chriſtians bodies; ſhould after that write ſuch E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtles, teaching the ſaluation of their ſoules; that he ſhould after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards indite Letters full of truth, and piety; that now conueyed Letters full of Blaſphemy and Wrong. Thine is thy Power and Goodneſſe, O God! Thou art able not onely to worke Good, out of Euill; but of Euill, to make it Good. Thou canſt turne vs to thee, and change vs from our ſelues.

               <p>Not the length of many miles could couple <hi>Damaſcus</hi> to <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem:</hi> Fiue dayes iourney (at the feweſt) would but meaſure the diſtance betwixt the Townes. Neuertheleſſe, if Authority will

Height nor Depth, Length nor Bredth, are impediments to ſinfull wayes. Nothing is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to hinder a man from wicked workes: Fire and Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, cannot here forbid vs. Wee compaſſe Sea and Land, to wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry our ſelues in the wayes of wickedneſſe; and ſo wee gaine ſinne, wee complaine neither of loſſe, nor labour. Sinne (though many ſo thinke it not) is both a labour and a load. There is not the like toyle, and hazard, to winne Heauen; as to earne Hell: Some take more paines to damne, then ſome to ſaue their ſoules. Chriſts yoke is light, and yet we take it not; Sinnes load is heauy, and for all that, we feele it not. Not onely our Sauiour ſo enlightens vs, that his yoke is but eaſie; but alſo Satan ſo ſedu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:19357:194"/>vs, that his burden ſeemes but light. The way of ſinne (we know) is a broad way; but ah (ſay we) that it is no longer. It is hard to weary vs in our owne, and ſinfull waies. Would God, the fearefull perils in the end, were throughly diſcerned; as the falſe profits and pleaſures in the way, are obſcurely glanced at: the ſinner might ſit ſtill, &amp; ſaue the labour; with leſſe toyle, lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger gaine; and reape more by doing nothing, then doing worſe.</p>

                  <hi>Saul</hi> is now on his iourney; the beſt iourney that euer hee tooke; the worſt that euer hee vndertooke.

Now is he neere to <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> neere to Euill purpoſed; but (oh the Wiſedome and Goodneſſe of Diuine Prouidence!) nearer to Grace offered. The Wolfe is made a Sheepe euen then, when

The Phyſitian of his ſoule (prayſed be the power of his grace) heales him in the midſt of his madneſſe; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtores him in the very extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his Diſeaſe. No height of ſinne can forbid the force of grace. Alwayes, the more the weight of ſinne, the greater the worke of ſaluation. True Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerſion, is neuer too late: though late conuerſion, proues ſcarcely true. Better end with <hi>Saul,</hi> then with <hi>Iudas:</hi> but better begin as <hi>Iudas,</hi> then as <hi>Saul.</hi> For grace rooting, well enough, when ſoone enough: for grace bud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, ſoone enough, when well enough.

There is a time, when GOD hath mercy, on whom he will; and whom hee will, he hardeneth: when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardeth his owne aboue their worth; and repayeth the other according to their deſert.

<pb n="349" facs="tcp:19357:197"/>ſo much the more to witneſſe; by how much hee did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the truth. Mercy is Gods, and Sinne but mans; that can doe more good, then this other deſerue euill: Sinne cannot de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, whom Grace intends to ſaue. Election is of grace, not merits: At no time does Fauour reſpect Deſert. The man runnes on haſtily, and is as ſuddenly met withall. While an helliſh darkeneſſe was yet within him; <hi>Suddenly there ſhone round about him, a light from heauen.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Act. 9.3:</note> It is time for thee (Lord) to lay to thine hands; as a good and cunning Potter, to reforme the clay, which Satan hath miſſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. Lord, when thine elected ones runne on ſo ſwiftly to ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity and ſinne; returne thou them ſpeedily to thy Grace and Mercy.

Though he neuer ſo thirſts, and ſeekes the damnation; yet worke and fulfill thou the Saluation of my ſoule.</p>
               <p>Conuerſion is a worke of wonder: A man is ordinarily borne; but is maruellouſly rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, or borne againe.

The outward light did ſomewhat foregoe the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; yet ſo, as the inward alſo
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:19357:198"/>ſhone vpon the ſodaine. In a moment, is Grace infuſed, and Conuerſion inchoate: though in time, this other is conſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, and the firſt diffuſed. The light of Gods grace is ſodaine to all his Saints. Wee cannot ſay, when hee will make his face to ſhine vpon vs; ſuch his times and ſeaſons, are in his owne knowledge and power. Nor ſhone the ſigh ſo ſoone, as full: <hi>Alight ſhone round about him.</hi> Illumination ought to be totall; that the man of God may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. Conuerſion is none, if not compleat. Halfe is for an Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot; haue thou (O Lord) thine whole Babe. For all the powers of my Soule; Lord inlighten mine Vnderſtanding.

               <p>How powerfull, and ſpeedy, are the Workes of the Spirit? But the outward glimmerings of his bright rayes, but glance vpon vs; and ſtraightway they dazle and deiect vs. No ſooner ſaw <hi>Saul</hi> a light ſhining from Heauen;
<note place="margin">Act. 9.4.</note> but forth with <hi>he fell to the earth.</hi> That the Holy Ghoſt but ſhines vpon vs, is enough both to humble, and inſtruct vs. Great is the efficacy of ſauing Grace; that doth no ſooner ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach, but conuert; ſcarce touch, ere change vs. It can at once make a King, of a Sheep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard; a Prophet, of an Heardſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; an Euangeliſt of a Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cane; a Diſciple of a Fiſher-man;
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:19357:199"/>and a Doctour of the Gentiles, of a Perſecutour of the Church. See! now lyes <hi>Saul</hi> groueling, kiſſing the footſtoole; as not da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, not worthy to behold the Throne. Happy Fall was it, that gaue ſuch aduantage to his Riſe: For, hee roſe vp the beſt that could be; that fell bad e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough. Grace and corruption are now in one ſoule; as are Hot and Cold in one body: through their ſtrife ſo violent, and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable; the poore patient fals downe flat, he knowes not whether more rauiſhed, or ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed.

               <p>Behold at once the ſeuerall degrees of conuerſion, mutually reſpecting both the Agent and Patient. God ſtrikes, <hi>Saul</hi> fals; God cals, <hi>Saul</hi> anſwers; GOD
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:19357:200"/>commands, and <hi>Saul</hi> obeyes. Bleſſed ſtroke! that heales in wounding: ſweet ſpeech, that incourages, euen reprehending: and facile Iniunction, that ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, in commanding. Happy deiection, that raiſes in the fall; modeſt anſwere, intimating ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgement; true obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wanting no willingneſſe. How aſcends Conuerſion in her ſteps; but from Contrition, to Confeſſion, and ſo to ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? His contrition and humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation is, he fals to the earth: for his Confeſſion, both is it annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by his ſilence, and conui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by his ſpeech: And ſo his Obedience, as the beſt ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, anſwering ſo readily, and ſo chearefully beſtowed. My Thoughts of Sorrow, my words of Acknowledgement, my Deeds of Obedience; theſe all muſt auouch me, ſeated in the ſtate of Grace.</p>
               <p>The hand of earth, that durſt

Hee ſtarts at his calling, what would he haue done at his rebuking? How could hee haue withſtood him puniſhing, that is not able to abide him conuerting? God thus ſmites him, to heale him: that otherwiſe would haue ſmitten God, to haue wounded himſelfe. I accept his ſtrokes, for fauours: nor feare I euill from him; with whom (I know) it is eaſier (which is impoſſible) to doe nothing, then not good.</p>
               <p>Hauing firſt ſtricken downe, hee ſeconds his blowes with words: God is one that will doe nothing wherein his Word ſhall not iuſtifie his Deed.

               <p>
                  <hi>Saul</hi> was learned in the law; but was yet but ignorant of the Goſpell. He could ſpeake of <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houah,</hi> the God of <hi>Abraham, I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaac,</hi> and <hi>Iacob,</hi> but could not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue in <hi>Ieſus,</hi> the Sauiour of the world. May be, had God appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after that manner, and to thoſe purpoſes of old; namely, as a mighty and auenging God, he alſo would haue anſwered, <hi>Speake Lord, for thy ſeruant heareth:</hi> But to heare now of ſuch a God, as is ſuffering, and to feele him ſo forgining; he askes, <hi>Who art thou Lord?</hi> The words are of one
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:19357:203"/>doubting, and yet diſpoſed to beleeue. To ſay <hi>who art thou,</hi> all this argues ignorance; to ſay <hi>Lord,</hi> is a ſigne of ſome faith. He ſhewes him here docible, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther then inquiſitiue: Nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed askes hee, as he would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine; but to be inſtructed. We muſt not be curious to inquire onely; but deſirous to learne the truth. I will inquire my God ſo, as to beleeue him: and ſo be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leeue him, as beyond inquiry.</p>
               <p>To ſtriue againſt the ſtreame, is difficult; is dangerous to kicke againſt the pricke. A wiſe man wil there deride the vanity, and here eſchew the dammage. Will he ſmite an adamant, till the blow rebound in his owne face? He will not ſhoot at the Moone, leſt the arrow light on his owne pate. Neither the Power, nor Grace of God, is to bee reſiſted. Hee that ſpurnes at a Stone or pricke, hurts not them, but him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelfe. What gets hee that will

It is not for a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters veſſell, to iuſtle with an fron Rod. There is no profit of a vaine and vnperfect labour, but much hurt in an vnequall and vaine contention.
